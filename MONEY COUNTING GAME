#Define variables
penny= .01
nickel= .05
quarter= .25
dollar= 1.00

#PROMPT THE USER TO ENTER # OF PENNIES, NICKELS, QUARTERS
userPennies= int(input("Please enter the amount of Pennies you have: "))
userNickels= int (input ("Please enter the amout of Nickels you have: "))
userQuarters= int(input ("Please enter the amount of Quarters you have: "))

#CALCULATE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF COINS USER HAS
totalPennyAmount= userPennies * penny
totalNickelAmount= userNickels * nickel
totalQuarterAmount= userQuarters * quarter
#CALCULATE TOTAL
totalCoinAmount= float(totalPennyAmount+ totalNickelAmount + totalQuarterAmount)

#DISPLAY OUTCOMES
if totalCoinAmount == dollar:
      print ("CONGRATULATIONS! YOU WON THE GAME!")
else:
      if totalCoinAmount > dollar:
            print (f" You lost! Your total amount is ${totalCoinAmount: .2f}, which is greater than a dollar!")
      else:
            print (f"You lost! Your total amount is ${totalCoinAmount: .2f}, which is less than a dollar!")
