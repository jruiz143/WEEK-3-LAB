#PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 6: DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT ASKS THE USER TO ENTER A MONTH (IN NUMERIC FORM), A DAY, AND A TWO-DIGIT
#YEAR. THE PROGRAM SHOULD THEN DETERMINE WHETHER THE MONTH X THE DAY EQUALS THE YEAR. IF SO, DISPLAY "THE DATE IS MAGIC"
#OTHERWISE, DISPLAY "IT IS NOT MAGIC"

#ASK FOR USER TO ENTER MONTH
month= int(input("Please enter month in numeric form (1-12): "))
day= int(input ("Please enter a day of the month (1-31): "))
year= int (input("Please enter the last two digits of the year: "))
#Format the if-else statement
magic= month * day
if year == magic:
      print ("THE DATE IS MAGIC!")
else:
      print ("THE DATE IS NOT MAGIC!")
