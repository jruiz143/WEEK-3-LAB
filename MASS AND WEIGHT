#IF YOU KNOW THE THE AMOUNT OF MASS AN OBJECT IN KILOGRAMS, YOU CAN CALCULATE ITS WEIGHT IN NEWTONS
#WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMULA: WEIGHT=MASSX9.8
#WRITE A PROGRAM THAT ASKS THE USER TO ENTER AN OBJECT'S MASS, THEN CALCULATES ITS WEIGHT. IF THE OBJECT WEIGHS MORE THAN
#500 NEWTWONS, DISPLAY THAT IT IS TOO HEAVY. IF LESS, DISPLAY IT IS TOO LIGHT

#Ask for user input
