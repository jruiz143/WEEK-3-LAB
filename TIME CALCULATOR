#PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 14: WRITE A PROGRAM THAT ASKS THE USER TO ENTER THE AMOUNT OF SECONDS AND WORKS AS FOLLOWS:
#THERE ARE 60S IN A MINUTE. IF SECONDS ENTERED GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 60, THE PROGRAM SHOULD CONVERT THE # OF SECONDS TO
#MINUTES AND SECONDS. THERE ARE 3,600 SECONDS IN AN HOUR. IF THE # OF SECS ENTERED IS GREATER THAN 3,600 THE PROGRAM SHOULD
#CONVERT THE NUMBER OF SECONDS TO HOURS, MINUTES, AND SECONDS. THERE ARE 86,400 SECS IN A DAY. IF THE # ENTERED IS GREATER
#THAN OR EQUAL TO 86,400 THE PROGRAM SHOULD CONVERT # OF SECONDS TO DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES, AND SECONDS
